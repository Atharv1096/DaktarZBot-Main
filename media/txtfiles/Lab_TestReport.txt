People with diabetes should get the test done more often if their blood sugarstays too high or if their healthcare provider makes any change in the treatment plan. HbA1c concentration represent the integrated valuesfor blood glucose over the preceding 8-12 weeks and is not affected by daily glucose fluctuation, exercise & recent food intake.Please note, Glycemic goal should be individualized based on duration of diabetes, age/life expectancy, comorbid conditions, known CVDor advanced microvascular complications, hypoglycemia unawareness, and individual patient considerations.Factors that interfere with HbA1c Measurement: Hemoglobin variants, elevated fetal hemoglobin (HbF) and chemically modifiedderivatives of hemoglobin (e.g. carbamylated Hb in patients with renal failure) can affect the accuracy of HbA1c measurements.Factors that affect interpretation of HbA1c Measurement: Any condition that shortens erythrocyte survival or decrease meanerythrocyte age (e. g., recovery from acute blood loss, hemolytic anemia, HbSS, HbCC, and HbSC) will falsely lower HbA1c test resultsregardless of the assay method used. Iron deficiency anemia is associated with higher HbA1c.Note: Presence of Hemoglobin variants and/or conditions that affect red cell turnover must be considered, particularly when the HbA1cresult does not correlate with the patient's blood glucose levels. • HPLC - High performance liquid chromatographyName: Mr.OM PRAKASH GOYALOrder ID: 3509681Age/Gender: 85/MaleRegistration Date: 14-Oct-21 02:35 PMPatient ID: 1MG3445Collection Date: 14/Oct/2021 06:33AMBarcode ID: A4297019Sample Receive Date: 15/Oct/2021 08:44AMReferred By: SELFReport Status: Final ReportSample Type: WHOLE BLOOD-EDTAReport Date: 15/Oct/2021 04:16PMBIOCHEMISTRYGOOD HEALTH PACKAGETest NameResultUnitBio.

Serum Iron alone is unreliable dueto considerable physiologic diurnal variation in the results with highest values in the morning and lowest values in the evening as well asvariation in response to iron therapy . Total Iron Binding capacity (TIBC) is a direct measure of the protein Transferrin which transports iron from the gut to storage sites inthe bone marrow. Increased levels of TIBC suggest that total iron body stores are low, increased concentration may be the sign of Irondeficiency anaemia, polycythemia vera ,and may occur during the third trimester of pregnancy. Decreased levels may be seen in hemolyticanaemia, hemochromatosis, chronic liver disease, hypoproteinemia ,malnutrition. Unsaturated Iron Binding Capacity (UIBC) is increased in low iron state and decreased in high iron concentration such ashemochromatosis. In case of anaemia of chronic disease the patient may be anaemic but has adequate iron reserve and a low uIBC.  Transferrin Saturation occurs in Idiopathic hemochromatosis and Transfusional hemosiderosis where no unsaturated iron bindingcapacity is available for iron mobilization. Similar condition is seen in congenital deficiency of Transferrin.Name: Mr.OM PRAKASH GOYALOrder ID: 3509681Age/Gender: 85/MaleRegistration Date: 14-Oct-21 02:35 PMPatient ID: 1MG3445Collection Date: 14/Oct/2021 06:33AMBarcode ID: A4297018Sample Receive Date: 15/Oct/2021 08:44AMReferred By: SELFReport Status: Final ReportSample Type: SerumReport Date: 15/Oct/2021 06:05PMBIOCHEMISTRYGOOD HEALTH PACKAGETest NameResultUnitBio.

Reducing elevated levels of atherogenic cholesterol will lower ASCVD risk in proportion to the extent that atherogenic cholesterol isreduced. This benefit is presumed to result from atherogenic cholesterol lowering through multiple modalities, including lifestyle and drugtherapies.Atherosclerosis is a process that often begins early in life and progresses for decades before resulting a clinical ASCVD event. Therefore, bothintermediate-term and long-term or lifetime risk should be considered when assessing the potential benefits and hazards of risk-reductiontherapies.Nonlipid ASCVD risk factors should also be managed appropriately, particularly high blood pressure, cigarette smoking, and diabetesmellitus.Name: Mr.OM PRAKASH GOYALOrder ID: 3509681Age/Gender: 85/MaleRegistration Date: 14-Oct-21 02:35 PMPatient ID: 1MG3445Collection Date: 14/Oct/2021 06:33AMBarcode ID: A4297018Sample Receive Date: 15/Oct/2021 08:44AMReferred By: SELFReport Status: Final ReportSample Type: SerumReport Date: 15/Oct/2021 06:05PMBIOCHEMISTRYGOOD HEALTH PACKAGETest NameResultUnitBio.

TSH is now firmly established as the first-line thyroid function test to assess thyroid status for mostclinical conditions. Interpretation of the results of thyroid function tests is facilitated by an understanding of thyroid hormone physiology,especially the normal inverse relationship between free T4and TSH concentrations.Changes in thyroid status are normally associated withconcordant changes in T3,T4 and TSH concentrations (e.g. raised T4 and T3 with suppressed TSH in thyrotoxicosis; low T4 and T3with elevated TSH in hypothyroidism).  An abnormal TSH requires further investigation, including measurement of free T4. In mostclinical situations involving discordant FT4 and TSH results, the TSH test usually yields the most diagnostically reliable result, providedthat the patient is not receiving medications that directly inhibit TSH secretion, and there are no conditions affecting the pituitary-thyroidaxis.. Using TSH as a single criterion has been shown to accurately classify the thyroid state of a patient in over 95% of cases. Non-thyroidal illness (NTI), pituitary disease and various drugs can all affect the axis and cause discrepancies between TSH levels, thyroidhormone levels and the clinical state. Measurement of the TSH level is indicated for patients with symptoms suggestive of thyroiddysfunction, reduced bone mineral density, dyslipidaemia, depression, or atrial fibrillation.Total T4 measures the total amount of thyroxine circulating in the bloodstream. Indications:Used to make diagnosis of underactive oroveractive thyroid when TSH is abnormal • Used with TSH for monitoring patients with Graves’ disease • Newborn screening test forhypothyroidism • Fairly accurate in patients with no protein abnormalities and not pregnant Free T4 measures the available, unboundamount of thyroxine in the bloodstream. Free T4 is critical for evaluating patients with hypothalamic-pituitary disease. It is also useful for evaluating the response to levothyroxinein cases of poor compliance and in the first months of treating patients with chronic, severe hypothyroidism.The total T3 test measures the total amount of triiodothyronine circulating in the bloodstream. Free T3 measures the free, unbound levelsof the hormone triiodothyronine available for use by the body.Total T3 measurements, however, should be performedIn patientssuspected of having T3 thyrotoxicosis and in patients taking drugs that inhibit the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 (such asdexamethasone, propranolol, propylthiouracil, amiodarone, and iodine-containing contrast media)Maternal hypothyroidism causes adverse effects on fetal psychomotor development, highlighting the significance of evaluating thyroidfunction during pregnancy.Tests should be performed pre-pregnancy or in the first trimester with TSH tests that can detect mild thyroidfailure. During pregnancy, the total levels of T3 and T4 are high because of increased TBG, and free T4 levels may slightly increaseduring the first trimester but will subsequently decline in the second and third trimesters.Name: Mr.OM PRAKASH GOYALOrder ID: 3509681Age/Gender: 85/MaleRegistration Date: 14-Oct-21 02:35 PMPatient ID: 1MG3445Collection Date: 14/Oct/2021 06:33AMBarcode ID: A4297018Sample Receive Date: 15/Oct/2021 08:44AMReferred By: SELFReport Status: Final ReportSample Type: SerumReport Date: 15/Oct/2021 05:48PMImmunologyGOOD HEALTH PACKAGETest NameResultUnitBio.
